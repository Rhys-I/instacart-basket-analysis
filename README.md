# Python Portfolio â€“ Instacart Basket Analysis

Welcome to my Python project portfolio! This repository showcases the Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and final report from my Achievement 4 project in the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Immersion program.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The Instacart Basket Analysis project explores purchasing behavior using transaction and customer data from a large grocery delivery service. The goal was to derive actionable insights about customer segments, spending habits, product categories, and time-based trends.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Objectives

- Clean, wrangle, and merge large datasets using pandas  
- Create new variables and segmentation flags  
- Perform aggregations and grouping analysis  
- Visualize trends using matplotlib and seaborn  
- Prepare a professional final report with insights and recommendations

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure

- `/data/` â†’ Raw and prepared datasets (note: raw data is not uploaded to GitHub for privacy)  
- `/notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter Notebooks covering data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization  
- `/visualizations/` â†’ PNG charts and plots created during the project  
- `A4_final_report.xlsx` â†’ Final stakeholder report summarizing key findings  
- `Module 4 Output Draft.docx` â†’ Draft summary of module outputs and reflections

## ðŸ“ˆ Example Insights

- **Most Orders by Hour** â†’ Peak orders between 9 AM and 5 PM, with a spike mid-morning  
- **Customer Loyalty** â†’ Majority are regular customers, with room to grow the loyal segment  
- **Price Sensitivity** â†’ Low- and mid-range products dominate purchases  
- **Customer Profiles** â†’ Segments identified: large families, young singles, young parents, affluent customers  
- **Regional Trends** â†’ Regional spending patterns highlight marketing opportunities

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

Key charts include:
- Histogram of orders by hour  
- Bar chart of customer loyalty distribution  
- Line plot of average price by hour  
- Scatterplot of age vs. income  
- Profile distributions by region and department

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- pandas, NumPy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Excel (for final reporting)

## âœ… Notes

All scripts follow Python best practices:
- Clean, modular code  
- Clear inline comments  
- Descriptive variable and function names  
- Well-labeled charts and saved outputs
